NAME
    DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::URI - Auto-create URI objects from columns

SYNOPSIS
    Load this component and then declare one or more columns as URI columns.

      package Resources;
      __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/InflateColumn::URI Core/);
      __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
          url => {
              datatype => 'varchar',
              size => 255,
              is_nullable => 1,
              default_uri_scheme => 'http',
              is_uri => 1,
          },
      );

    Then you can treat the specified column as an URI object.

      print 'stringified URI: ', $resource->url, "\n";
      print 'scheme: ', $resource->url->scheme, "\n";
      print 'domain: ', $resource->url->host, "\n";
      print 'path:   ', $resource->url->path, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module inflates/deflates designated columns into URI objects.

  Methods
    default_uri_scheme
        Gets/sets the default scheme to use when no scheme is specified in
        the URI.

          __PACKAGE__->default_uri_scheme('http');

        You can also set this on a per column basis, as shown in the
        "SYNOPSIS".

    register_column
        Chains with the "register_column" in DBIx::Class::Row method, and
        sets up currency columns appropriately. This would not normally be
        directly called by end users.

SEE ALSO
    URI, DBIx::Class::InflateColumn, DBIx::Class.
